Usability is the measurement of how easily users can accomplish their goals.

We measure this by coming up with a plan to observe users, observing them, and reporting on what worked for them, and what was a barrier.

This reporting has to be filtered through our expert opinion, as users may not know WHY things didn't work for them, or how to fix them.
