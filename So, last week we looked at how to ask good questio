So, last week we looked at how to ask good questions that will give us reliable data.

We talked about how to vet those questions for bias (peer review).

We talked about how to script those questions (and/or the language that frames them) in order to keep our data consistent, and avoid leading the subject.

Today we're going to talk about the 5-step process that's going to get you to the finish line (aka your final report):
- collecting our data
- compiling our data
- analyzing our data
- reporting our data
- presenting our data

Collecting
- qualitative frameworks

Compiling
- CSV in git
- google sheets
- airtable

Analyzing 
- Facts / Interpretation / Speculation
- https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations
- https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/
- Post hoc -  Task analysis

Reporting
- Recap of _relevant details_ plan to establish legitimacy (look at the recaps in writing response)
- _relevant_ data
- Recommendations for actionable change, and recommendations for further study
- Supporting materials

Presenting
- start with your conclusions and work backwards
