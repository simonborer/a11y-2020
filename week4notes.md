what is the dom, and what does it have to do with assistive devices?


The DOM is a model of an HTML document.

HTML is text. The DOM is how the browser (and others) "think" about it.

The DOM API is a set of methods for interacting with, and manipulating, the DOM via Javascript.

Your computer has ports (USB, et al.). You can plug things into it to a) get things from it (for example, data, or power), or b) add things to it (a mouse, an external hard drive, etc.).

Similarly, the DOM gives us "access points" to read, manipulate and augment it.




The point is that when you create an HTML document, you are not creating JUST a document. You are presenting content THAT IS MEANT TO BE INTERACTED WITH in a wide variety of ways.
