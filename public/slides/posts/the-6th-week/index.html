    <h2>Learnings from the usability test plans</h2>
    <p>Any assignment I receive from you is, in a way, user data. I can look at it and better understand how my users (students) are succeeding (or not) in achieving goals.</p>
    <p>So, even though I can be pretty direct in my critiques, I hope you understand that all I'm trying to do is deliver information in an iterative release cycle.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Your audience is not qualified.</h3>
    <p>One misconception I saw repeated often was discussion of how "qualified" your test participants are.</p>
    <p>But your users aren't qualified.</p>
    <p>Similarly, sometimes a teacher can focus on how their most enthusiastic students are doing.</p>
    <p>But I think it's important to run a class that's as good for slackers as it for keeners. Which is not to say I want people putting in different levels of effort to get the same grade. Of course not - I still want to reward effort. But I hope to run classes where someone can quickly skim the notes the night before a big assignment and understand the absolute basics.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>User testing is not about finding the best, most qualified test participants. It is about finding test participants who act and think like your audience will act and think. <strong>The basic features of your website should be easy for everyone.</strong></p>
    <p>Which leads me to my next point:</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>When you 'assume', you make errors you can't see.</h3>
    <p>The most egregious error I saw in the test plans was a fundamental misunderstanding about the purpose of user testing.</p>
    <p>Some of you (not most of you, but several of you), created a test plan where your testers would "divide and conquer" - testing different parts of the website, or testing for things like database integrity, or form validation.</p>
    <p>Usability testing is not for <strong>errors that your team can recognize</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>The purpose of usability testing is to see if the assumptions you made about your audience are correct.</p>
    <p>I would guess that everyone who made this error in their test plan has a pre-existing technical background, because this is the kind of testing that gets done on code - QA, unit testing, integration testing, etc. I kept seeing the phrase "as expected" come up - we'll test to see if things are working as expected.</p>
    <p>Based on their previous experience, people made assumptions about the content of this course, and it did not work out well.</p>
    <p>The purpose of usability testing is to <strong>test your assumptions</strong> and <strong>discover the unexpected</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>Your audience are real human beings, and they will not behave the way you want them to. Your job is to build things based on their needs, not what you <em>hope</em> their needs are.</p>

</section>
<section>
    <p>A few more things that I saw that could've been improved with some usability principles applied:</p>
    <h3>Aesthetic and minimalist design</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A 3-page document doesn't need a table of contents</li>
        <li>If you're going to add a section just because it's "supposed" to be there without adding any meaningful content, just leave it out.</li>
        <li>You don't need to describe all the different features of a website that you're <em>not</em> testing.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Flexibility and efficiency of use</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Executive Summary should be an 'accelerator'. I should be able to understand the feasibility of your test plan from reading that one paragraph. If it is not an accelerator, omit it. Also, (and for that reason), you should put it at the beginning.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Consistency and standards</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Some documents tried to sound more professional by complicating things. That doesn't work. Professional writing uses specialized language for the sole purpose of being very precise about complicated subjects - thus simplifying understanding, not complicating it.</li>
        <li><p>On the other hand, some documents didn't use standard usability terms in the standard way.</p><p>A test scope, for example, is a definition of what assumptions you are testing, and what angle you'll take to test them. It is not a description of all the features on the website, nor is it a document summary.</p></li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Error prevention</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>This was a common issue - allowing more environmental variables than necessary, i.e. not making an effort to limit the number of different browsers users perform the test on. The more complicating factors, the more you can't be sure about the conclusions you draw from your data.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <ul>
        <li>Let's say you have 3 users - one using Safari on an iPad, one using Firefox on a PC, and one using Chrome on Mac. They take 30 seconds, 60 seconds, and 90 seconds to complete a task. Are the variations because of the OS? the browser? the device viewport? browser plugins? or are they because of the user demographics? or did you describe the task differently to each user because you didn't write it down for yourself?</p>
        <p>If you want to <strong>learn things about people</strong>, you need to <strong>reduce the variables that aren't behavioural</strong>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Many test plans said they would use "subjective measures", without explaining what those measures were. Imagine reading a recipe that said "take a measurement of ingredients and put it in the oven for an amount of time". That would not be a recipe you'd trust!</li>
        <li>Finally, the most important part of a plan is demonstrating why it will succeed. I think perhaps the most popular metric was "time on task". But very few people said why that would produce actionable results. As we discussed, sometimes users take a long time to complete a task because they're enjoying the experience. Many documents made assumptions about how long a task "should" take. To that I say, "who cares"? And if you can't document the answer to that question - "who cares?" - then you need to reconsider your metric.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section id="final">
    <h2>Final project - good luck!</h2>
    <p>You're going to do great. All you're doing is reporting on the results of the test you planned, exactly as we discussed in <a href="/posts/the-3rd-week/#reporting" target="_blank">Week 3<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.

    <p>Your presentation should run no more than 5 minutes (time yourself ahead of time to be sure!) You will be required to present the findings of your test in person.</p>
    <p>A slide presentation is acceptable, as is a longform document that you talk us through. Either way though, your report needs to present what you did, why you did it, what the results are, and what your recommendations are based on those results. You must also have data that backs up your conclusions (although you don't necessarily need to talk through every single data point, as that would be pretty boring).</p>

<section>
    <h3>Bonus points</h3>
    <p>I will be awarding up to 3 bonus points per person. These will be added to your final assignment mark. They will be awarded based on the questions you ask to your classmates about their assignments.</p>
    <p>Ask these questions from a client's point of view.</p>
    <p>Make sure they are <strong>questions</strong>. You won't get bonus points by being mean.</p>
    <p>The point of these questions is to give your classmates the opportunity to address any potential weaknesses in their methodology or recommendations.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>If you're being asked a question, don't get defensive - take it as an opportunity to explain why you made your choices, and to explain how any weaknesses could be addressed going forward, either with further testing, or by doing things differently next time.</p>

    <h2>Why you can't (entirely) lint for accessibility</h2>
    <p>As we've seen throughout our studies, accessibility is about communicating intention: What is the meaning of a picture? How is a user supposed to interact with a component?</p>
    <p>If these meanings were programmatically discernable, the assistive technology would figure it out for us. A script can check for the <em>existence</em> of an alt tag, but not whether the alt tag is <em>accurate</em>.</p>
    <p>As web developers, your job is to ensure that meaning reaches the user.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Your job is not to write code - it is to solve problems</h3>
    <p>All the easy code has been written already. Don't worry, there are (for the time being), still plenty of jobs writing boring code. But that is less true than it was ten years ago, and will be less true in another ten. You need to think of yourself as someone who can solve the problem of 'How can we best make this work for everyone who needs it?'</p>
    <p>In the past, we contrasted accessibility with usability by saying that usability is accessibility for a set audience, but accessibility legislation still limits that audience by defining it. You should always be open to expanding your definition of the end user.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Youtube stumbled on an audience</h3>
    <p>A few years ago, the Youtube dev team gave themselves a page-weight budget of 800kb. They optimized every conceivable aspect of the site. They predicted that they could get the average load time below 1s. When they released their new, lightning fast code, their average load times tripled.</p>
    <p>There were millions of users in the global south who suddenly were able to watch videos without the page timing out. The team had stumbled onto a massive audience they didn't know they had simply by taking best practices seriously.</p>
    <p>Do what you can for those you're aware of, and keep looking for those you aren't.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Users at cross-purposes</h3>
    <blockquote>I’m dyslexic, and one of the recommendations for reducing visual stress that I’ve found tremendously helpful is low contrast between text and background color. This, though, often means failing to meet accessibility requirements for people who are visually impaired... Consider:
        <ul>
            <li>Designing for one-handed mobile use raises problems because right-handedness is the default—but 10 percent of the population is left handed.</li>
            <li>Giving users a magnified detailed view on hover can create a mobile hover trap that obscures other content.</li>
            <li>Links must use something other than color to denote their “linkyness.” Underlines are used most often and are easily understood, but they can interfere with descenders and make it harder for people to recognize word shapes.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Accessibility in Front-end JS Frameworks</h3>
    <p>Today we're going to look at <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/#front_end_frameworks_section_overview" target="_blank">the big three<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>
    <p>Before that though, let me point you to a fascinating read: WebAIM's <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/" target="_blank">Screen Reader Survey<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>Let's keep in mind that >2% of users in the WebAIM survey are using IE 6, 7 or 8, for a whopping total of 14.5% using an outdated browser (IE).</p>
    <p>

<section>
    <h3>Let&#39;s assume...</h3>
    <p>Let's assume you've got your fallbacks and polyfills in place. Let's assume SSR isn't an option. How do we make Vue, React and Angular accessible?</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>You have most of the tools necessary already:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Update page titles</strong> when appropriate</li>
        <li><strong><code>aria-live</code> regions</strong> for content updates</li>
        <li><strong>Focus management</strong> when navigating</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Accessibility in Angular</h3>
    <p><ul><li><a href="http://codelyzer.com/" target="_blank">Codelyzer<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> for monitoring angular's a11y "traps"</li><li><code>liveAnnouncer</code> for content updates, along with other <a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/a11y/api" target="_blank">accessibility tools<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> in the Angular code development kit.</li></ul></p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Accessibility in React</h3>
    <p>React is a lot more on top of accessibility.</p>
    <p>React, first of all, has a pretty mature routing ecosystem with accessibility largely factored in.</p>
    <p>Aria attributes are supported in JSX (but note that they're <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#wai-aria" target="_blank">lowercased instead of camelcased<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> like most other attributes), and the `for` attribute, used with labels, is written as `htmlFor` in JSX.</p>
    <p>The best approach to take is to integrate aXe's <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe" target="_blank">auditing library in react<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Accessibility in Vue</h3>
    <p>Vue doesn't have any <a href='https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/issues/974' target='_blank'>accessibility documentation... still</a>.</p>
    <p>Emily Mears has written <a href="https://blog.mears.dev/getting_started_with_accessibility_in_vue/" target="_blank">a pretty great article<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> about accessibility in Vue. The main challenges are held in common with React - updating meta, handling focus and implementing aria.</p>
    <p>Whereas Vue has been the "new kid on the block" framework for a few years now, it tends to be a follower when it comes to accessibility. It has <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/vuejs-vuejs-accessible-announcements" target="_blank">an announcer<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> like Angular, and <a href="https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-axe" target="_blank">aXe-based auditing<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> like React, but neither as well-implemented or mature as the older framework.</p>
    <p>One thing it does have going for it is an <a href="https://github.com/vue-a11y" target="_blank">active accessibility community<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>
