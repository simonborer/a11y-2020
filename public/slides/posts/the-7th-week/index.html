            <h3>OCAS</h3>
            <p>Tudor Whiteley will be coming in at noon today to meet you and address any questions you have in regards to the desktop+mouse testing.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>WAI-ARIA deep dive</h3>
    <p>As we covered earlier, WAI-ARIA, a.k.a. ARIA, is a specification from the W3C that uses element attributes to supplement existing semantics <ol>
            <li>to provide more information about your markup, and</li>
            <li>provide information about content that updates without a page refresh.</li>
    </p>
    <p>This is especially relevant when you are using a front-end javascript framework (Angular, React, Vue, et al.).</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>Remember that the spec tells us that we should use native semantics when they are available.</p>
    <p>If it's a button, use a < button>.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>ARIA roles</h3>
    <p>The role attribute provides information about an element's purpose.</p>
    <p>The role attribute identifies the element to the screenreader, but it <em>does not</em> recreate the native functionality. That's on you.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>role=&#34;button&#34;</h3>
    <p>Let's say, for whatever reason, you need to make a button out of something that's not < button>,
            < input type='button' />,
            < input type='submit' />,
            < input type='reset' /> or
            < input type='image' />.</p>
    <p><code>role='button'</code> identifies any element as a button to a screenreader. Use this in conjunction with <code>tabindex='0'</code> - the role itself does not make the element focusable.</p>
    <p>Remember, too, that a native HTML button will fire an onclick event when space or enter are pressed - so you're also responsible for recreating that native functionality.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>More roles! - widgets</h3>
    <p><code>checkbox</code></p>
    <p><code>dialog</code> (this can be a modal, or not)</p>
    <p><code>link</code></p>
    <p><code>log</code> (i.e. a chat log)</p>
    <p><code>marquee</code> (like a <code>log</code>, but not vital or linear, i.e. a carousel or stock ticker)</p>
    <p><code>progressbar</code></p>
    <p><code>radio</code></p>
    <p><code>scrollbar</code></p>
</section>
<section>
    <p><code>slider</code> (i.e. a range slider or volume control)</p>
    <p><code>spinbutton</code> (a value selection input with up and down arrows)</p>
    <p><code>status</code> (a status update message, i.e. `your changes have been saved`</p>
    <p><code>tablist</code> > <code>tab</code> + <code>tabpanel</code></p>
    <p><code>grid</code> > <code>row</code> > <code>rowheader</code> + <code>cell</code> + <code>columnheader</code></p>
    <p><code>menubar</code> > <code>menu</code> > <code>menuitem</code> + <code>menuitemcheckbox</code></p>
    <p><code>textbox</code></p>
    <p><code>timer</code></p>
    <p><code>tooltip</code></p>
</section>
<section>
    <p><code>tree</code>/<code>treegrid</code> > <code>treeitem</code></p>
    <p><code>switch</code> identical to <code>checkbox</code>, but strictly for values of on or off</p>
    <p><code>listbox</code> > <code>option</code></p>
    <p><code>radiogroup</code> > <code>radio</code></p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Even more roles! - document structure</h3>
    <p><code>article</code></p>
    <p><code>definition</code></p>
    <p><code>directory</code> (i.e. table of contents)</p>
    <p><code>document</code></p>
    <p><code>group</code> (of UI elements not in a perceivable page section)</p>
    <p><code>heading</code></p>
    <p><code>img</code> (useful in case of background images)</p>
    <p><code>list</code> > <code>listitem</code></p>
</section>
<section>
    <p><code>math</code> (there is an entire markup language for mathy stuff! it's called <a href='https://www.w3.org/Math/whatIsMathML.html' target='_blank'>MathML</a> and can be called into other markup, like HTML)</p>
    <p><code>note</code></p>
    <p><code>presentation</code> - similar in function to aria-hidden; this tells the screenreader that the element is decorative, but <a href='http://john.foliot.ca/aria-hidden/' target='_blank'>support for it on natively focusable elements is interesting</a>.</p>
    <p><code>region</code></p>
    <p><code>separator</code></p>
    <p><code>toolbar</code></p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>And finally... more roles! - landmarks</h3>
    <p><code>application</code> - for when your HTML document behaves completely different from a standard html document; probably don't use this. It turns off all standard keyboard shortcuts in most screenreaders.</p>
    <p><code>banner</code> - analogous to < header>
    </p>
    <p><code>complementary</code> - like < aside>
    </p>
    <p><code>contentinfo</code> - like < footer>
    </p>
    <p><code>form</code></p>
    <p><code>main</code></p>
    <p><code>navigation</code></p>
    <p><code>search</code></p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Widget attributes</h3>
    <p><code>role="combobox|textbox" aria-autocomplete="none|inline|list|both"</code></p>
    <p><code>role="checkbox|switch|..." aria-checked="true|false|mixed"</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-current="page|step|date|location|time|true|false"</code></p>

    <p><code>aria-haspopup="true|false|menu|listbox|tree|grid|dialog"</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-hidden="true|false|undefined"</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-invalid="true|false|grammar|spelling"</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-label={string}</code> only for invisible text</p>
</section>

    <p><code>role="combobox|gridcell|listbox|radiogroup|spinbutton|textbox|tree" aria-required="true|false"</code></p>
    <p><code>role="gridcell|option|row|tab" aria-selected="true|false|undefined"</code></p>
</section>
<section>
    <p><code>role="columnheader|rowheader" aria-sort="ascending|descending|none|other"</code></p>
    <p><code>role="range|scrollbar|separator|slider|spinbutton" aria-valuemax={number} aria-valuemin={number} aria-valuenow={number}</code></p>
    <p><code>role="range|separator" aria-valuetext={string}</code></p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Live region attributes</h3>
    <p><code>aria-live="polite|assertive|off"</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true|false"</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-live="polite" aria-relevant="additions|text|removals|all"</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-live="assertive" aria-busy="true|false"</code></p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Implicit live region attributes</h3>
    <p>Several roles have implicit live region values:</p>
    <p><code>role="alert"</code> has an implicit <code>aria-live="assertive"</code></p>
    <p><code>role="status"</code> and <code>role="log"</code> have an implicit <code>aria-live="polite"</code></p>
    <p><code>role="timer"</code> and <code>role="marquee"</code> have an implicit <code>aria-live="off"</code></p>
    <p>These can be overridden by explicitly declaring <code>aria-live</code> values.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Relationship attributes</h3>
    <p><code>role="application|composite|group|textbox" aria-activedescendant={id}</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-controls={id}</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-describedby={id}</code> similar to <code>aria-labelledby</code>, but verbose instead of concise</p>
    <p><code>aria-labelledby={id}</code></p>
    <p><code>aria-flowto={id}</code> gives the user the option to move to an element, overriding the source order</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p><code>aria-owns={id}</code> Defines a parent-child relationship when one isn't semantically apparent. To understand how this is different from <code>aria-controls</code>, imagine a carousel. The arrows on the left and right would have <code>aria-controls</code> attributes. The dots at the bottom that correlate to individual slides would have <code>aria-owns</code> attributes.</p>
    <p><code>role="article|listitem|menuitem|option|radio|tab" aria-setsize={integer} aria-posinset={integer}</code> Only required when not all elements from the set are included in the DOM.</p>

    <h3>Accessibility in Front-end JS Frameworks</h3>
    <p>Today we're going to look at <a href='https://stateofjs.com/2017/front-end/results' target='_blank'>the big three</a>.</p>
    <p>Let's keep in mind that >4% of users in the WebAIM survey were using IE 6, 7 or 8.</p>
    <p>
        <table>
            <caption>Browser support of javascript frameworks</caption>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Vue</td>
                    <td>ES5-compliant browsers - IE9+</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>React</td>
                    <td>ES5-compliant browsers - IE9 and IE10 require polyfills</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Angular</td>
                    <td>Modern browsers. Safari 7 & 8, IE9, 10 & 11, Android 4.1+ require polyfills.</td>
                </tr>

    <h3>Progressive enhancement</h3>
    <p>Within the last year, we've seen companies like Airbnb and Groupon tell Firefox and Safari users that they are 'optimized for Chrome' when their sites failed.</p>
    <p>What if your website, to borrow a phrase, just worked?</p>
    <p>Consider delivering your content in plain HTML, and then 'mustard-cutting' to deliver your CSS and Javascript.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Internet Explorer refuses to die.</h3>
    <p><a href='https://netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx' target='_blank'>Internet Explorer market share is >12%.</a> That's more than Firefox. That's more than Edge, Safari and Opera combined.</p>
    <p>Internet Explorer fails to support <em>hundreds</em> of features that Chrome has implemented.</p>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is how we build for an internet that is increasingly fractured.</p>
    <p>Polyfills, autoprefixer, caniuse, modernizr; these are great things. Consider, though, simply delivering content that any client can access as a Minimum Viable Product.</p>
    <p>A List Apart has <a href='http://alistapart.com/article/the-slow-death-of-internet-explorer-and-future-of-progressive-enhancement' target='_blank'>a wonderful article</a> with some recommendations on how to mustard cut for both CSS and Javascript.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>What are you using your framework for?</h3>
    <p>Is it as a static site generator? Cool. Render on the server. Serving static HTML is waaaay faster.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Let&#39;s assume...</h3>
    <p>Let's assume you've got your fallbacks and polyfills in place. Let's assume SSR isn't an option. How do we make Vue, React and Angular accessible?</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Accessibility in Angular</h3>
    <p>AngularJS 1.7 shipped with a module called ngAria which created hooks for some aria roles. Angular 2+ seems to not have anything similar. You're on your own!</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Accessibility in React</h3>
    <p>React seems to be a lot more on top of accessibility. They even bother to mention it in <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html' target='_blank'>their docs</a>!</p>
    <p>Aria attributes are supported in JSX (but note that they're lowercased instead of camelcased like most other attributes).</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>A few gotchas with React</h3>
    <p>JSX has a tendency to break semantics though, especially with lists and tables, so get familiar with <Fragment>s and <></> syntax.</p>
    <p>The `for` attribute, used with labels, is written as `htmlFor` in JSX</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>React A11y</h3>
    <p><a href='https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y' target='_blank'>react-a11y</a> is a promising looking tool for warning about potential accessibility issues in your React components.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Accessibility in Vue</h3>
    <p>Vue doesn't have any <a href='https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/issues/974' target='_blank'>accessibility documentation... yet</a>.</p>
    <p>Emily Mears has written <a href='https://medium.com/@emilymears/getting-started-with-web-accessibility-in-vue-17e2c4ea0842' target='_blank'>a pretty great article</a> about accessibility in Vue. The main challenges are held in common with React - updating meta, handling focus and implementing aria.</p>
    <p>Vue is pretty great as a framework - it's easier to pick up and understand than other frameworks, it scales much more gracefully than React, and only updates the components that need re-rendering.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Controlling focus in client-side frameworks</h3>
    <p>All three frameworks aggressively re-render the DOM - that's kind of the point.</p>
    <p>Be aware that changes to the URL, and rendering of the virtual DOM can wreak havoc on focus. Each framework has methods for mitigating this with programmatic focus control: <a href='https://simplyaccessible.com/article/react-a11y/' target='_blank'>refs in React</a>; <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-focus' target='_blank'>vue-focus in Vue</a>; <a href='https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngFocus' target='_blank'>ngFocus in Angular</a>. Make sure you're familiar with the appropriate technique.</p>

    <h3>Presentations - turning data into stories</h3>
    <p>Right now you're generating data. Your work for your final assignment is <ol>
            <li>understand the data</li>
            <li>generate and compare solutions</li>
            <li>tell a story</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Presentations - understanding the data</h3>
    <p>First, think about what kind of data you're looking at. Is it quantitative? If so, compare it to a) industry standard benchmarks, and b) the needs of the client. Is the pageload time >2 seconds? Does your gazeplot completely miss the big sales banner?</p>
    <p>If it's qualitative, really listen to what people have told you (verbally or otherwise), and be careful not to project your own assumptions. Think about it individually and collectively - was something annoying, but only to one person? Was some UI element a little bit frustrating for every single user?</p>
    <p>Don't forget, 'what worked' can be as important as 'what didn't'.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Presentations - solutions</h3>
    <p>Now that you've understood your data, it's time to generate some solutions.</p>
    <p>Keep solutions specific and positive - 'don't use hamburger menus' isn't an action, it's a non-action.</p>
    <p>The gold standard is 'elegance', which is just a fancy way of saying 'cheap, fast, easy and effective'.</p>
    <p>Most solutions won't be elegant though. It's up to you to be mindful of how resource-heavy your solutions are - and how certain you are of their efficacy.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>The more uncertain you are of a solution, the more you'll need to be prepared to present multiple options, and to speak to the pros and cons of each one.</p>
    <p>Consider laying out your solutions in a chart graded for issue severity and actionability.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Presentations - telling a story</h3>
    <p>The point of all this is to give people something they can use. Data is boring. If your report puts them to sleep, they won't use it. Anecdotes are fun, but lack credibility. People won't use your report if they don't feel they can trust it.</p>
    <p>Use enough data to build a credible story, but focus on appealing to the things that people really pay attention to.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>Be funny. Be informal. Think of your report as having <a href='http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit' target='_blank'>a beginning, middle, and end</a>. Tell the story of the website, the testing, the results, and the solutions. And yes, even the data.</p>
    <p>The best way to do this is to focus on people. Talk about yourself, the participants, the website's audience, the client. That's the only real way to help us all figure out why the data matters.</p>

        <h3>Bonus points</h3>
        <p>I will be awarding up to 3 bonus points per person. These will be added to your final assignment mark. They will be awarded based on the questions you ask to your classmates about their assignments.</p>
        <p>Ask these questions from a client's point of view.</p>
        <p>Make sure they are <strong>questions</strong>. You won't get bonus points by being mean.</p>
        <p>The point of these questions is to give your classmates the opportunity to address any potential weaknesses in their methodology or recommendations.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="slide-only">
        <p>If you're being asked a question, don't get defensive - take it as an opportunity to explain why you made your choices, and to explain how any weaknesses could be addressed going forward, either with further testing, or by doing things differently next time.</p>

        <h3>Office culture</h3>
        <p>Office culture is different from most other workplaces and it's definitely different from school.</p>
        <p>Offices have their own dialect, customs, style of dress, form of humour, and expectations around behaviour and communication.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="slide-only">
        <p>Every office is a little different. One question I like to ask when being interviewed is "What can you tell me about the culture here?</p>
        <p>This is a question about how to dress, how to talk to your co-workers, how supported you'll be in your work, and how aggressively you'll be expected to self-manage.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="slide-only">
        <p>Office culture in Canada is undergoing a generational shift.</p>
        <p>Older customs tend to be more formal in language and dress, more strict about job definitions and parameters (including work hours), and with more deference to authority.</p>
        <p>"Younger" offices tend to place more of an emphasis on 'likeability', blurring the lines between work and recreation, and have higher expectations about taking on responsibility.</p>
        <p>Expect to find an older office culture in larger institutions like universities, banks, and government.</p>
        <p>If the company you're working for has ever described itself as a 'startup', expect to have your work interrupted by grown men playing with children's toys.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="slide-only">
        <p>Particular attention needs to be paid to language. Some offices have a culture where, in some contexts, swearing or using <span role="img" aria-label="beaming face with smiling eyes">😁</span> is the norm. What's important is that you communicate using the same norms as the rest of your team/office.</p>
        <p>Despite the generational differences, offices everywhere tend to be much gentler when communicating differences of opinion than, say, a restaurant or a construction site.</p>
        <p>However, there is an expectation that you will communicate your needs. Otherwise people will keep being polite with you - until they politely fire you.</p>

        <p>Jessica's going to tell us a story about people being polite to her - in a bad way.</p>

    <section class="slide-only">
        <h3>Why am I telling you this?</h3>
        <p>Modern office culture has certain expectations around 'respectfulness'. When addressing other people's ideas, <em>even when they're dumb ideas that make you angry</em>, you'll be expected to smile, say something positive, and then address your concerns by asking a gentle question.</p>
        <p>When you are asking questions today, your challenge is to ask questions that will get the answers you need, while still maintaining a good relationship with everyone in the room.</p>

        <h3>Let&#39;s review!</h3>
        <p>But first - something I was reminded of.</p>
        <p>I was reading some writings by people with disabilities, and a point that kept coming up was this - no one is disabled.</p>
        <p>Which is to say, there is nothing about any one person that creates disability. Disability is created when society makes an assumption, and then hardcodes that into design.</p>
        <p>It's in the way we design our buildings and our cities, our school system, our language, et al.</p>
        <p>I think this is important, because you need to understand that when you make something, you are at risk of manufacturing disability.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility review</h3>
        <p>Accessibility is both a philosophy and a legal requirement.</p>
        <p><strong>Philosophy</strong>: removing barriers and creating equity.</p>
        <p><strong>Law</strong>: The Access for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, in accordance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, mandates a level of WCAG compliance.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>WCAG compliance mandates semantics, content, proper source order, text alternatives to visual information, accomodations for colour-blindness and low visual acuity, keyboard-only functionality, and the use of the WAI-ARIA specification.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p><strong>Semantics</strong> in HTML refers to using native elements and attributes for their defined purpose.</p>
        <p>A correct <strong>source order</strong> means that the visual flow of the document matches the source code.</p>
        <p><strong>Text alternatives</strong> are provided when information is presented visually - this includes images, graphs, charts and tables, but also cases where elements have implicit functions based on the visual design, i.e. buttons within a form.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>We can provide alternatives to this visual information with <code>alt</code> tags for graphic content, <code>scope</code> and <code>caption</code> for tables, and <code>label</code>s or screen reader-specific content for inputs, buttons and links.</p>
        <p>We must also keep in mind that our elements are often used as navigational landmarks for people using non-visual clients, including headers for document structure.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Accessible <strong>content</strong> means...</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="fragment">Unique page titles (as it can be difficult to assess if the page has actually changed otherwise)</li>
            <li class="fragment">Concise link text (as screen readers read them in their entirety)</li>
            <li class="fragment">Accessible information about link behaviour</li>
            <li class="fragment">Skippable navigation</li>
            <li class="fragment">Captions and transcriptions that contain all relevant visual information</li>
            <li class="fragment">Verbose error messages (that capture focus), and</li>
            <li class="fragment">Using words rather than ASCII symbols</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Because not all visually impairments require the use of a screenreader, we provide <strong>alternatives to colour cues</strong> for people with colour-blindness (i.e. focus outline, proper labelling), and for people with reduced visual abilities we check our <strong>colour contrast ratios</strong> and test our websites for up to <strong>200% zoom</strong>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>For people with motor-impairment issues, we ensure that we do not disable the native functionality of our proper semantic HTML, and where native functionality is not available, we create <strong>keyboard events</strong> to supplement our click events.</p>
        <p>We also maintain our tab order by having our source order properly represented.</p>
        <p>On those rare occasions where our visual order and source order are in conflict, we can control focus with Javascript.</p>
        <p>Where we want to make an element focusable that does not have native focusability, we can use the <code>tabindex='0'</code> attribute value.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>The <strong>WAI-ARIA</strong> specification allows us to supplement our HTML elements, widgets and document presentation by defining roles and properties for screenreader users.</p>
        <p>This is especially important when updating content on the page without a location change or page refresh, which is a common practice when using modern front-end javascript frameworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Of course we keep in mind that all these standards apply whether on a desktop or mobile device, with a few special considerations for mobile, including...</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="fragment">Maintaining keyboard functionality</li>
            <li class="fragment">Supporting different orientations</li>
            <li class="fragment">Touch target size and spacing</li>
            <li class="fragment">Gesture alternatives, and </li>
            <li class="fragment">Appropriate virtual keyboard data types.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>In order to enforce accessibility compliance and best practices, we need to help our team mates understand these techniques. We can encourage our team to use <strong>manual testing tools</strong> like the WAVE browser plugin, incorporate <strong>linting</strong> into our build process and <strong>auditing</strong> into our deployment or site monitoring</p>
        <p>Additionally, because some accessibility techniques, especially ARIA, are context-dependent, automated enforcement can be a challenge. Manual <strong>code review</strong> is an essential part of making our whole team stronger and our product better.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Usability review</h3>
        <p>Usability is not UAT, UX, UI, CX, HCI, IxD, or HCD (although they may overlap).</p>
        <p>Usability is <q>the extent to which specified users can find, understand and use information and services</q>.</p>
        <p>To start with a solid foundation of usability, we develop personas and scenarios.</p>
        <p>To assess usability, we test.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>In testing, we use a variety of methods, designed to reduce our biases, to collect data on how real people perceive and interact with the design and function of the products we make.</p>
        <p>We do this iteratively throughout the design and production process (including after our product has launched), testing our ideas and improvements, and comparing solutions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>During the initial design phase, we develop <strong>personas</strong>, composite identities of our audience, in order to design our product <em>for people to use</em>.</p>
        <p>Based on those personas, since websites tend to be non-linear tools, we develop <strong>scenarios</strong>. Scenarios help us keep track of the different journeys that people in our audience may take in using our product.</p>
        <p>Personas and scenarios are tools for guiding design and implementation discussions, particularly with less technical team members.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Once we begin to test our design and development, we use tests to produce both <strong>qualitative</strong> and <strong>quantitative</strong> data.</p>
        <p>Depending on what kind of data we are generating, there are industry standard sample sizes for each test. Qualitative testing, being more exploratory, tends to have smaller sample sizes.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>To facilitate discussion and decision-making, we can apply quantitative metrics to qualitative data. One example of this is the PURE rubric, for assigning values to the ease with which a task is accomplished.</p>
        <p>This should not overshadow the fact that the most valuable information gained in qualitative testing is usually individual, and best reported in the words of the participant or observer.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Before we test, we plan. After we test, we report.</p>
        <p>A good test plan can be a <strong>proposal</strong> (when seeking approval) that provides a clear picture of the time and costs, and makes a case for the efficacy of data that is being generated.</p>
        <p>A good test plan might also be, assuming that approvals and funding are secured, <strong>simple documentation</strong> for your team, in order to keep sight of the scope, definitions, and goals.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>A good report is readable, credible, and makes clear recommendations for how to action the findings.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>A friend of mine who does usability testing says that their team has a library of possible tests. They get hired to choose the right test.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Usability tests include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="fragment">problem discovery</li>
            <li class="fragment">heuristic evaluation</li>
            <li class="fragment">system usability surveys</li>
            <li class="fragment">moderated/unmoderated</li>
            <li class="fragment">in-person/remote</li>
            <li class="fragment">benchmarks</li>
            <li class="fragment">eye-tracking</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>When performing a test, we try to capture data that is clean and unbiased. We can do this by using careful language, so as not to influence our test participants.</p>
        <p>We also do this by having strong sample sizes, and reducing the number of variables between our tests, i.e. maintaining a consistent hardware and software environment.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Once our test data is collected, we format it, and discuss it within our team.</p>
        <p>Collaborating on our recommendations reduces individual bias.</p>
        <p>We then weigh our recommendations based on issue severity and the resources required to implement.</p>
        <p>Whenever possible, we try to provide more than one option for each issue, so the client can decide what is best for them - without putting them in the position of rejecting our work.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>A report should be easy to read and understand. Choosing the right format for presenting data is essential to interpreting it.</p>
        <p>If you have been rigourous in your testing, then your report can be presented in very plain language.</p>
        <p>Reporting these results is often done in-person. It's important that you understand everything that went into the test and the recommendations, and anticipate questions that the client may raise.</p>
